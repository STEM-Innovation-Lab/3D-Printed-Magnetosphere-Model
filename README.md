Information about 3D Printed Magnetosphere Model

The [3D Printed Magnetosphere Model](http://d2e3j4dnfz1tx9.cloudfront.net/img/profiles/Exploration_Idea_Profile_3DMagnetosphere.pdf) was created by citizen science project [Aurorasaurus](https://aurorasaurus.org/) in collaboration with [NASA's STEAM Innovation Lab](http://www.steaminnovationlab.org/) and the [Magnetosphere Multiscale Mission](https://mms.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (MMS). This Version 1.0 is an intermediate-level print project intended to be expanded upon by Makers, educators, subject matter experts (SMEs), and the general public. **Safety note: This model contains small pieces and may contain neodymium magnets. Use caution with younger learners.**
